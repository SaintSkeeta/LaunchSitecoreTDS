<p>A Content Management System by its name manages content, but it also must handle the presentation of that content. While these are related, it is important to look at them individually.</p>

<p>When discussing a Content Management System, it is important to understand the term content. This is especially true in Sitecore because of the separation of content and presentation elements within the product.</p>
<p>The definition of content is substantive information or creative material viewed in contrast to its actual or potential manner of presentation. With this definition, we can discuss the text and related digital assets of a website separate from the look and feel of the presentation.</p>
<h3>Content Terms</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Data Template: The data structure and framework around which content is created. </li>
  <li>Fields: The individual components of a Data Template where data is entered into the system </li>
  <li>Field Types: Determines the manner in which data is entered or selected. These include single-line text, multi-line text, rich text, numbers, checkbox, checkbox list, and many others. </li>
  <li>Inheritance: Data Templates can inherit from other base templates to allow templates to share field definitions. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Data Templates</h3>
<p>The starting point for adding content is through the creation of data templates. Let's use this article item as an example. As stated earlier, a template can inherit from other templates - making it easy to manage things like titles, metadata, etc. in one location, rather than copying from template to template.</p>
<p><img width="595" height="309" alt="Content of the current article in Content Editor (with field sections collapsed)" src="~/media/FD0C719FA60145C4AC73FB7334A74B64.ashx" style="height: auto; width: auto;"></p>
<p>You'll note this article is made up of many fields, and those fields are sorted into field sections. (The Quick Info is a system field section, present on every item so developers/information architects/etc. can easily look up the item ID, path, template, owner, etc. </p>
<p>I have collapsed those field sections so we can see them all in one screenshot. If you click on the template /sitecore/templates/Launch Sitecore/Article you'll launch the Template Editor and you will see that the template is actually quite small - there are only a few fields. Adding new fields and sections is as simple as typing in the appropriate box, and selecting a field type.</p>
<p><img src="~/media/B989DAF8442946FDA6AEB33916C477E7.ashx" alt="Template Manager view of an Article Template" style="width: 640px; height: 165px;"> </p>
<p>As for all the other fields and field sections such as tagging, menu display and the main text - these are actually inherited from other templates. If you click the Content Tab, you can see all the inherited templates.</p>
<p><img src="~/media/4B2D82BC97C94A499839AA19522E552D.ashx" alt="Inherited templates" style="width: 640px; height: 324px;"></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Content Items</h3>
<p>Once Data Templates are created, we use these to create content items. A content item is simply an instance of a template. By storing this content apart from the visual presentation, it can be reused across multiple pages, sites, or even on a mobile version of the current site. This results in less editing and more consistency as well as better content.</p>
<p>Everything in Sitecore is stored in the Content Tree as an item. This can be assets such as PDFs or images, content primary used to make pages (such as this article page) metadata, content used in components on pages. Even the Sitecore system settings such as templates and workflows are stored in the same way.</p>
<p>By having everything in a single repository, this makes it easy to reuse data (and reuse code accessing that data). For example, in this article template, there is a field called Prerequisite Articles and with the source field showing /sitecore/content/Home/articles. This means that the moment someone adds a new article, it is automatically able to be used as a source for this field. You can get fairly complex filtering with the Source attribute, and find more info in the <a href="http://sdn.sitecore.net/upload/sitecore6/65/data_definition_reference_sc64-65-usletter.pdf" title="Data Definition Reference " target="_blank">Data Definition Reference </a>on SDN.</p>
<p>The rules governing what content can be created where, are known as Insert Options. These are the rules that prevent users from say, creating a Press Release in the Products section. This (and all these concepts) are covered in greater detail in the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=D14659DD559C4D318B75AA1C3E82542D&amp;_z=z">Build my First Site</a> exercises.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Showing a Page</h3>
<p>When a request is made in Sitecore, a few steps are taken to determine what content to deliver as well as the presentation of that content. This is all handled behind the scenes, but it is important to understand that this binding of content to presentation is very different than storing them together in a dependent manner. To learn more about the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=5EA97F1D068546379D3DD4F289BA7950&amp;_z=z">presentation</a> and the <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=68DAE74D1B6D4411967BCD80321355D3&amp;_z=z">binding</a> just keep reading.</p>
