<h2>Getting Started with Presentation Elements</h2>
<p>You've created your content infrastructure - your data templates and your content tree. Now, we need to allow public users of your site to view the content you have created.</p>
<p>We've got you started with a layout, which will include some default styling for your site. You'll be creating both a generic Sublayout for displaying content on your home item and a product Sublayout for displaying product specific content on each product item. (All of the code you need will be provided in this document.)</p>
<ul>
 <li>A Sitecore layout is the highest-level presentation construct in Sitecore. In ASP.NET terms, a layout is a Web Form (.aspx). It includes all of the page elements that should appear throughout the site. Layouts can have placeholders, allowing you to place Sublayouts and Renderings on a page.</li>
 <li>A Sitecore Sublayout is a small sub-section/building block of a page. In ASP.NET terms, a Sublayout is a User Control (.ascx). Sublayouts can also have placeholders.</li>
 <li>A Sitecore XSLT Rendering is also a small sub-section/building block of a page. It is written using XSL. This is provided as reference only, as we will not be developing using XSL in this document. XSL Renderings cannot contain placeholders.</li>
</ul>
<p>We know that every page on our site should include a header, footer and side menu. Including these in our layout will ensure the header, footer and side menu appear on every page request. The placeholder on the layout indicates that we will place other presentation elements (i.e. sublayouts or renderings) into this part of the page. As a reminder of our overall presentation elements:</p>
<p><strong><img style="width: 550px; height: 308px;" alt="Presentation Overview 1" src="~/media/17B89793F2144617AD76CC8FF26940CB.ashx" /><br />
</strong></p>
<p>The "content" placeholder will have further presentation elements placed in it. For the Home Page, we will configure Sitecore to put the Generic Display into the content placeholder. For the Product pages, we will configure Sitecore to put the Product Display into the content placeholder.</p>
<p>In this activity, we will start by creating the side menu sublayout. Then we will create the layout and place the side menu and placeholder onto it. Our layout (.aspx) will look like this:</p>
<p><strong><img width="596" height="263" alt="Presentation Overview 2" src="~/media/120B1A10638B427E99F5AC8FDA25E9AB.ashx" /></strong></p>
