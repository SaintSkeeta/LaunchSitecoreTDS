<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>As developers, we work on the data and other Sitecore elements with the Desktop and other Sitecore tools such as the Content Editor. Business Users have an easier option called the Page Editor. With it they can navigate the site as they normally would, and make changes directly on the web page. They also may insert new data items that the developer has previously configured for them as insert options. </p>
<p>In this activity, we will edit content of the Home Page. In addition, we had previously configured the Insert Options for the Home Page to allow inserting new products, so we will insert a new product. We will mimic what a Business User would do and open the Page Editor from the Sitecore Login screen. However, as a developer we could have opened the Page Editor from the Sitecore button in the desktop tool we have been using. </p>
<h3>Activity - Using Page Editor</h3>
<p>Open a new Browser window. Go to Sitecore's login page (http:// launchsitecore /sitecore) and select "Page Editor" if you are on the Advanced screen or "Edit Web Page" if you are on the Login screen. Login using the "admin" username and the "b" password. </p>
<p><img alt="" width="500" src="~/media/758DDC4357AF47F19EBFD608CA95991A.ashx" /></p>
<p>Click on Edit and you can directly edit the content of the page. </p>
<p><img alt="" width="500" src="~/media/421EF7A7540A45CE8AC1FAA4F722688A.ashx" /></p>
<p>When you are finished, select Save &amp; Close. Now that you are no longer editing, you can easily navigate the site. </p>
<p><img alt="" width="500" src="~/media/0F46061C1FED480F89986C56A429FE94.ashx" /></p>
<p>Let's add a new product. On the displayed Ribbon, go to the "Home" tab. Click Insert. You will see Product as an insert option. </p>
<p><img alt="" width="466" src="~/media/DD894C996A2D4560B94211E07AFADA45.ashx" /></p>
<p>Name your new item "Product 4" then click Insert. Sitecore will automatically bring up the new product in edit mode. </p>
<p><img alt="" width="500" src="~/media/5491EAE39C434D509FB57D8C2059634B.ashx" /></p>
<p>Save your changes. </p>
<p>Your new product and other editing changes have been made to the work-in-progress database. At some point you want to move your changes to the live web site. This also can be done from the Page Editor. </p>
<p>To publish from within the Page Editor, click Publish. Choose the "Smart Publish" option to publish our changes. After publishing has completed, select Logoff to see the live site. </p>
